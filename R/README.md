In abc_paper_examples.R can be found code for the examples from the paper “Approximate Bayesian computation using the Fourier integral theorem."
Demarcated by comment blocks, each section is largely self-contained. The Fourier method relies on parallelism, implemented through the parallel package in R, the speed advantage conferred depending on the system on which the code is being run, and can be controlled by modifying the relevant parameters, such as nsim, the size of the pseudo data set, and m, the number of independent instantiations, as discussed at the end of Section 3. The code also provides means of effecting the Yeo-Johnson transformation, specified in Section 4.2, using the bestNormalize and VGAM packages in R. The cntx parameter can be used to implement either Monte Carlo within Metropolis (MCWM) or grouped independence MH (GIMH), as described in Section 2, with a variation on MCWM the default.

The univariate and multivariate mixture examples, which appear in Sections 5.2 and 5.4, respectively, serve to reveal the advantages of the Fourier approach in accurately approximating the posterior distribution, in comparison with the respective alternative approaches, namely, the Cramer-von Mises (CvM) full-data method and kernel density estimation (KDE).
The g-and-k distribution example, which appears in Section 5.1, corresponds to the example in Drovandi and Frazier’s paper "A comparison of likelihood-free methods with and without summary statistics." Similarly, the M/G/1 queueing model, which appears in Section 5.3, can be found in that paper. Following the results produced by Drovandi and Frazier, we have compared the Fourier estimator with the best-performing method in each example, that is, the CvM for the g-and-k distribution and KDE for the M/G/1 queue.  The data along with additional comparisons can be obtained from https://github.com/cdrovandi/ABC-dist-compare. We have adapted the relevant code from Matlab to R for the aforementioned methods.
To demonstrate the Fourier’s performance on a hierarchical model, we also provide an additional example, a multivariate g-and-k model, as depicted in Figure 3 of Clarte et al.’s paper “Component-wise approximate Bayesian computation via Gibbs-like steps.” For further computer resources on the component-wise method, see https://github.com/GClarte/ABCG.
Finally, the Ricker model example, which appears in Section 5.5 and involves both hierarchy and time-dependence, compares the Fourier approach with the synthetic likelihood (SL) approach of Wood, as presented in  “Statistical inference for noisy nonlinear ecological dynamic systems.” To implement the SL approach, we have relied on the software found at https://www.maths.ed.ac./~swood34/simon/software.html
